This is a simple command-line utility to create a kernel bin file from an SRecord file.

You'll have to run publish.bat to convert the resulting DLL into an EXE.
Sorry about the extra step.
Had I realized that Visual Studio doesn't produce an EXE by default for .Net Core console apps, I would have just targeted Windows instead.
