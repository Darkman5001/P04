 99-02 Pcm's (512K) 
The somewhat common formula floating around on the net goes...
key = 0x934D-swapab(seed)

It has been my experience that that formula does not work on very many of the 03+ 1mb pcm's

Here’s an example using the Seed found in a 2005 Silverado Pcm.
Seed=77 EC
Key=A6D6

To solve:  key = 0x934D-seed(byte swapped)

So 934D - EC77 = -592A
The math is correct but it didn’t work. 

So I reversed the formula….
EC77 + A6D6 = 1934D  

It appears that GM changed the starting value of the equation so they could cover a 
broader range of possible Seed and Key combinations in the 03+ 1mb pcm’s.  

Here is an example of the pseudo code I used to solve this for all the 3rd gen Ls pcms

if (solveKey = true)
       	   If (Key= 4 bytesLong)
              	   then (write key)

        	  Else( Key =  5 bytesLong)
            		     read bytes 2,3,4,5 (throw out 1st digit) 
Then ( write key)
 
else (solveKey = false)


So to solve for all 99-07 Pcms use the equation:
key = 0x1934D-swapab(seed)
Then if you get a 5 byte answer just toss out the first byte and you have your key.

I’m sure there are other ways to do this but I have yet to find a pcm I can’t unlock with this method; 
assuming that no one has altered the factory key such as a “tuner lock” to prevent you from reading 
the pcm and seeing what they have done. 



You can find calculators online that will add and subtract the HEX for you such as:
